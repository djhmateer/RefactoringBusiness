<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>Given code in a business, how do I make things better, so I become a happier developer?</p>

<p>I aim to do this by </p>
<ul>
    <li>Being pragmatic</li>
    <li>Example led</li>
    <li>Inspired writings by:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Scott Gu</li>
        <li>Scott Hanselman</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>

<h2>Technology in this Site</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>ASP.NET MVC5 (not the latest ASP.NET5, MVC6 EF7 stack!)</li>
    <li>VS2015 (project upgraded from a VS2013 MVC app - however VS2015 works just as well using ASP.NET 4.6 template)</li>
    <li>Bootstrap theme - Yeti from <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">http://bootswatch.com/</a></li>
    <li>Source Control - <a href="https://github.com/djhmateer/RefactoringBusiness">https://github.com/djhmateer/RefactoringBusiness</a> </li>
    <li>Continuous Integration / Build server: <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/djhmateer/refactoringbusiness">https://ci.appveyor.com/project/djhmateer/refactoringbusiness</a> </li>
    <li>Continuous Deployment to Azure <a href="http://refactoring.azurewebsites.net/">http://refactoring.azurewebsites.net/</a> </li>
    <li>Website availability monitoring <a href="https://uptimerobot.com">https://uptimerobot.com</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>Am currently pushing to github master, which then calls Appveyor and Azure at the same time.  So if a build fails it will be pushed to live.  However this is very useful in 'dev' to get the site up asap...</p>
