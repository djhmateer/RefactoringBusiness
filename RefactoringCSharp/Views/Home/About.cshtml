<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>Given legacy code, how do I make things better?</p>

<h2>Technology</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
    <li>ASP.NET MVC5 (not the latest ASP.NET5, MVC6 EF7 stack!)</li>
    <li>VS2015 (project upgraded from a VS2013 MVC app - however VS2015 works just as well using ASP.NET 4.6 template)</li>
    <li>Bootstrap theme - Yeti from <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">http://bootswatch.com/</a></li>
    <li>Source Control - <a href="https://github.com/djhmateer/RefactoringBusiness">https://github.com/djhmateer/RefactoringBusiness</a> </li>
    <li>Continuous Integration / Build server: <a href="https://ci.appveyor.com/project/djhmateer/refactoringbusiness">https://ci.appveyor.com/project/djhmateer/refactoringbusiness</a> </li>
    <li>Continuous Deployment to Azure <a href="http://refactoring.azurewebsites.net/">http://refactoring.azurewebsites.net/</a> </li>
    <li>Website availability monitoring <a href="https://uptimerobot.com">https://uptimerobot.com</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Workflow</h3>
<p>Am currently pushing to github master, which then calls Appveyor and Azure at the same time.  So if a build fails it will be pushed to live.  However this is very useful in 'dev' to get the site up asap...</p>
